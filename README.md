## About
Cobalt Engine is a game engine using Entity-Component-Layer<sub><sub>(scenes)</sub></sub> system.  
I already made two engines in C# ([Streamline](https://github.com/fredtheking/Streamline-Engine), [Zephyrion](https://github.com/fredtheking/ZephyrionEngine)), and they sucked.  
So now im trying again, but with C++.

- Rendering with [SDL3](https://www.libsdl.org/)  
- Some multithreading (maybe?)  
- Custom architecture  

---

## Goals
- Play with C++ basics
- Mess around with threads and memory stuff  
- ??? (profit?)
